# Obseon

**Obseon** is a decentralized cultural gateway that blends music, storytelling, and quantum philosophy into a next-gen listening experience. Built on Solana, Obseon empowers artists and listeners to create, collect, and explore ephemeral sound moments through a spatialized marketplace, geo-aware vaulting, and an upcoming hardware player.

## What is this repo?

This repository contains the core components of Obseon for the [Solana Hyperdrive Hackathon 2025]. For this sprint, we are focusing on:
- A minimal prototype of the mobile app (React Native or Swift)
- A basic web interface for the spatialized marketplace (Next.js or SvelteKit)
- Conceptual backend structure (Firebase or Supabase)
- Early-stage Solana contract stubs (for minting & vault logic)

> Note: Many components are still in development. This repo serves as a foundation and proof of concept for the Obseon ecosystem.
